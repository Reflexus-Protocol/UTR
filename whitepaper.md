**Version 1.12**  
**Date: September 01, 2025**  
**Authors: REFLEXUS Development Team**

## Abstract

REFLEXUS Protocol presents UTR, a BSC-compliant token that merges native currency backing with fair dividend payments and direct, on-chain refund capabilities. Each UTR token draws value from the contract's accumulated reserves, while transaction fees enable proportional dividend distribution to holders through a fair percentage system. Users can redeem tokens for native currency at solid ever growing backing value, ensuring liquidity without market dependency. Featuring a capped supply, limited burns, and post-deployment ownership renouncement for true decentralization, UTR emphasizes balanced stability, equitable incentives, and long-term viability. This whitepaper examines the tokenomics, core functionalities, security architecture, and technical implementation.

## Introduction

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**

REFLEXUS Protocol uses BNB (Binance Coin) as its backing asset but is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or in partnership with Binance, Binance Smart Chain, or any Binance-related entities. UTR tokens are an independent project with no official connection to Binance. The use of BNB as backing is purely technical and does not imply any business relationship or endorsement.

In the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, tokens have evolved from basic value stores to sophisticated tools supporting governance, staking, and yield farming. However, many rely on external liquidity pools for trading and lack built-in backing, leaving them vulnerable to high volatility and liquidity shortages. REFLEXUS Protocol's UTR token tackles these issues by incorporating native currency reserves directly into the smart contract, enabling users to purchase and refund tokens at prices dynamically linked to the contract's balance. This establishes a self-contained ecosystem where circulating UTR tokens maintain real asset support, minimizing reliance on third-party exchanges for initial liquidity.

UTR stands out through its efficient combination of asset backing and fair dividend payments within a single contract. Unlike tokens needing separate liquidity setups or centralized price feeds, UTR supports direct on-chain exchanges between native currency (BNB) and UTR tokens, with refunds calculated from the effective backing to deter manipulation while preserving close value alignment. This delivers a reliable floor price, similar to stablecoins but free from overcollateralization or complex algorithms, paired with dividends that provide claimable rewards to holders. Ultimately, UTR delivers balanced stability and growth opportunities in a fully decentralized framework after ownership renouncement, building user confidence and streamlining DeFi engagement for broader, more practical adoption beyond pure speculation.

## Problems Resolved by REFLEXUS Protocol

REFLEXUS Protocol tackles key pain points in the cryptocurrency ecosystem with its backed, dividend-paying design. Below, we break down the major issues UTR addresses, the core differences between backed and non-backed tokens for users and market dynamics, how whales affect traditional tokens versus UTR, and the reasons most tokens lose their market capitalization over time.

### Current Crypto Problems UTR Resolves

#### Price Volatility
UTR's native backing and refund system create a reliable value floor, smoothing out the wild fluctuations seen in hype-driven tokens by tying prices to contract reserves.

#### Scams and Fraud
Through ownership renouncement, clear on-chain fee distributions, and direct conversions, UTR reduces rug-pull risks and hidden admin powers that plague many projects.

#### Regulatory Uncertainty
The asset-backed model and transparent operations better align with evolving rules for tokenized assets, potentially easing compliance compared to purely speculative coins.

#### Unnecessary Energy Use
As an ERC20 on efficient chains like BNB Smart Chain, UTR sidesteps the high energy demands of proof-of-work mining without compromising functionality.

#### Security Vulnerabilities
Built-in protections like reentrancy guards, auto-exclusions for contracts and liquidity pairs, and safe math operations mitigate common exploits such as dividend farming or overflows.

#### Lack of Intrinsic Value
Direct reserves from buys and controlled burns provide genuine utility and scarcity, contrasting with tokens reliant solely on marketing buzz or copy-paste mechanics.

### Difference Between Non-Backed and Backed Tokens

Non-backed tokens (e.g., many meme coins or utility tokens) derive value purely from market sentiment, community hype, or external integrations, making them highly speculative. For users, this means high-risk exposure to pumps and dumps, with no guaranteed exit liquidity beyond DEX sells (which can incur slippage). Market behavior is erratic: rapid gains during bull runs, but steep crashes when interest wanes, often leading to dead projects.

Backed tokens like UTR, supported by native reserves in the contract, offer tangible value tied to accumulated assets. Users benefit from predictable stability. Refunds provide a near-peg exit backing, reducing fear of total loss, and claimable growth via dividends. Markets exhibit more resilience: volatility is dampened by the floor price, liquidity is internal (no need for external pools initially), and long-term holding is encouraged, fostering steadier growth and broader adoption for practical use cases like payments or hedging.

### Impact of Whales and Big Money Users

In normal tokens, whales (large holders) can dominate markets by dumping holdings for quick profits, causing extreme price drops and panic sells among retail users. This manipulation erodes trust, amplifies volatility, and often leads to project abandonment as smaller holders exit.

With UTR, whales face built-in checks: large sells can trigger refunds instead of market floods, redistributing value via dividends to remaining holders and maintaining backing integrity. This "forced growth" mechanic (through reserve accumulation and token burns) turns potential dumps into ecosystem benefits, while the value floor discourages predatory behavior. Big money users are incentivized to hold for both forced growth and dividends rather than flip, creating a more balanced market where retail participants aren't as disadvantaged.

### Why Most Tokens Fail to Maintain Market Capitalization

Most tokens collapse due to unsustainable models: over-hyped launches with no real utility lead to initial pumps followed by dumps; copy-paste code lacks innovation, making projects interchangeable and forgettable; poor tokenomics (e.g., unlimited supply or misaligned incentives) erode value; scams or rug pulls destroy confidence; and external factors like regulatory scrutiny or market downturns expose weaknesses. Without intrinsic backing, these tokens rely on continuous hype, which fades, resulting in 90%+ value loss even within days.

UTR counters this with reserves ensuring baseline value, capped burns for controlled scarcity, forced growth through reserve accumulation, and dividends for ongoing interest rewards, prioritizing utility over speculation for enduring capitalization.

## Tokenomics Overview

Transparent and sustainable token economics designed for long-term value creation and benefits through innovative fee structures, refundable backing, and automated interest mechanisms. **Initial Distribution:** 100% minted to the contract address upon deployment. No pre-mine, airdrops, or team allocations—everything is earned through purchases.

### Key Token Metrics

- **Total Supply:** 1,250,000,000 UTR (Fixed supply with no minting capability)
- **Burn Limit:** 250,000,000 UTR (20%) (Maximum tokens that can be burned via refunds)
- **Base Price:** 0.0001 BNB/UTR (Starting price with dynamic adjustment)
- **Interest Share:** 0.05% - 0.10% (Per interaction distributed proportionally)

### Fee Structure (Basis Points)

| Transaction Type | Interest Fee | Reserve Fee | Burn Fee | Dev Fee | Total Fee |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Buy             | 10 BPS       | 10 BPS      | -        | 5 BPS    | 25 BPS    |
| Refund          | 5 BPS        | 7.5-15 BPS  | 7.5-0 BPS| 5 BPS    | 25 BPS    |
| Transfer        | 10 BPS       | 10 BPS      | -        | 5 BPS    | 25 BPS    |
| DEX Swap        | 10 BPS       | 10 BPS      | -        | 5 BPS    | 25 BPS    |

## Appendix A — Deep Fee Explanation

Technical details for developers and advanced readers.

The fee structure in REFLEXUS Protocol is thoughtfully designed to foster ecosystem sustainability, incentivize long-term holding, and preserve fundamental value. Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, where fees typically reward liquidity providers exclusively (as in DEX protocols) or result in unchecked burns, potentially triggering excessive deflation that erodes liquidity and hinders market participation, UTR channels fees into three complementary categories: reserves first (to fortify backing and drive forced growth), dividends second (for claimable interest rewards), and a modest share last for development. This structured, three-tier framework guarantees that each transaction bolsters the token's native reserves, drives "forced growth" through reserve accumulation, provides interest via dividends, and facilitates refunds as a secure, near-value-equivalent exit that strengthens overall system durability.

### How Fees Work Across Transaction Types:

#### Reserve Fee (7.5–15 BPS):
Takes a portion of UTR tokens from refunds and keeps them in the contract's balance, effectively removing them from circulation. These reserve tokens remain in the contract and are not actively sold back to the market. The mechanism works by: (1) removing tokens from circulation through reserve fees, (2) refunds paying out BNB from the contract's reserves, and (3) the remaining circulating supply having higher backing value per token. This creates a price floor that prevents downward manipulation and maintains backing value integrity without requiring external market interventions.

#### Dividend Fee (5–10 BPS):
The engine of interest distribution. This fee accumulates in the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally to all holders based on their token balance. For example, in a transfer:

```solidity
uint256 dividendFee = Math.mulDiv(amount, dividendFeeBps, 10000);
magnifiedDividendPerShare += (dividendFee * MAGNITUDE) / totalSupply;
totalDividendsDistributed += dividendFee;
```

When claimed, dividends are distributed to holders based on their proportional share of the total supply, akin to fair dividend payments that can be claimed manually by paying gas fees.

#### Dev Fee (5 BPS across all types):
A small portion allocated to the dev address for maintenance and ecosystem development. It is transferred via `_performTransfer(address(this), devAddress, devFee);`, ensuring transparent funding without external dependence.

### Forced Growth via Burn and Reserve Accumulation:

**Backing and Forced Growth:** Backing value only goes up through the forced growth mechanism: Buy premiums (0.1%) and reserve fees (0.1-0.15%) net positive BNB inflows. Burns on refunds enforce deflation (supply down → value up), with reserves stabilizing the curve. No external dependencies, purely internal. Every interaction where fees are taken (buys, transfers, DEX swaps, and refunds) includes a reserve fee that allocates UTR tokens back to the contract's balance. This reserve fee removes UTR tokens from market circulation and returns them to the contract's balance, where they remain as part of the contract's token holdings. The forced growth occurs through the reduction of circulating supply (via burns and reserve accumulation) combined with stable or increasing BNB reserves, not through active selling of reserve tokens.

During refunds specifically, the mechanism applies four fees: dev fee (5 BPS), dividend fee (5 BPS), burn fee (7.5 BPS when below burn limit, 0 when at limit), and reserve fee (7.5 BPS when below burn limit, 15 BPS when at limit). The burn fee permanently removes UTR tokens from circulation (up to 20% of total supply), while the reserve fee keeps tokens in the contract's balance, removing them from circulation. This combination of refunds (which pay out BNB), burning (which reduces total supply), and reserve fees (which remove tokens from circulation) ensures that the backing value per remaining UTR token increases, creating a price floor that prevents downward manipulation and maintains backing value integrity. The reserve tokens remain in the contract as part of its holdings and are not actively sold back to the market. This is fundamentally different from dividend interest, which distribute rewards without affecting the underlying backing value.

### Interest Distribution via Dividends:

Dividends represent interest payments to holders, where transaction fees are redistributed as claimable rewards in the form of fully backed UTR tokens. In normal crypto environments (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum), growth relies on market appreciation or manual staking/yielding, often requiring users to lock assets or pay gas for claims. UTR's dividends are unique in that they are:

- **Fair and Proportional:** Dividends accumulate automatically and are distributed proportionally to all holders based on their token balance. The system uses `magnifiedDividendPerShare` to ensure precise calculations without scaling factor complexity. This fair mechanism ensures no new tokens are minted, and all distributed dividends are fully backed UTR tokens with the same backing value as purchased tokens, distinguishing it from inflationary rewards in tokens like Dogecoin.
- **User-Controlled Claiming:** Holders can claim their accumulated dividends manually by paying a small gas fee, giving them full control over when to receive rewards. This prevents automatic exclusions and ensures all users can participate fairly.
- **Separate from Forced Growth:** Unlike forced growth which increases backing value, dividends are pure interest payments that don't affect the underlying BNB backing. They provide additional rewards on top of the forced growth mechanism.

### Refund Mechanism and Its Integration with Fees:

Refunds allow users to return UTR for native currency, but the actual payout is less than 99.9% of backing value due to fees. The refund process uses `effectiveBacking = balance * 999 / 1000` as the reference rate, but applies four fees to the UTR amount before conversion, resulting in a lower net payout. This is handled in `_handleRefund`, applying four different fees before payout:

```solidity
uint256 devFeeUTR = Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, REFUND_DEV_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 5 BPS
uint256 dividendFeeUTR = Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, REFUND_REFLECTION_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 5 BPS
uint256 burnFeeUTR = (_totalBurned < BURNING_LIMIT) ? Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 75, 100000) : 0; // 7.5 BPS or 0
uint256 reserveFeeUTR = (_totalBurned < BURNING_LIMIT) ? Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 75, 100000) : Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 150, 100000); // 7.5 or 15 BPS
uint256 utrForUserRefund = utrAmount - devFeeUTR - dividendFeeUTR - burnFeeUTR - reserveFeeUTR;
uint256 grossNativeValue = (utrForUserRefund * effectiveBacking) / currentCirculatingSupply;
```

- **How It Works:** The refund mechanism applies four fees to the UTR amount before conversion: dev fee (5 BPS), dividend fee (5 BPS), burn fee (7.5 BPS when below burn limit, 0 when at limit), and reserve fee (7.5 BPS when below burn limit, 15 BPS when at limit). Only the remaining UTR tokens (after fee deduction) are converted to BNB at 99.9% of backing value. For example, if you refund 1000 UTR tokens, approximately 750 UTR tokens (after ~25% in fees) are converted to BNB. Burn fees permanently remove tokens from circulation (up to 20% of total supply), while reserve fees keep tokens in the contract. This "forced" recycling ensures refunds contribute to growth (via burns reducing supply and dividends distributing interest rewards) rather than draining liquidity.
- **Unique vs. Normal Market:** Most tokens lack direct refunds; exits occur via DEX sells, risking slippage and impermanent loss. UTR's on-chain refunds provide guaranteed liquidity at a fair price, backed by reserves accumulated from fees, unlike rug-prone projects or stablecoins with collateral risks (e.g., USDT's off-chain reserves). The 99.9% reference rate prevents arbitrage exploits, while the burn cap (20% of total supply) avoids over-deflation, maintaining balance between scarcity and liquidity. Note that actual refund payouts are reduced by fees before conversion to BNB.

In summary, UTR's fees create a virtuous cycle: transactions fund growth (dividends), stability (reserves), and scarcity (burns), all within a backed framework. This is special because it transforms fees from a cost (as in normal markets) into a mechanism for enforced holder value, without the hype-driven volatility of meme coins or the complexity of layered DeFi protocols.

## Technical Description

REFLEXUS Protocol is implemented in Solidity 0.8.30, inheriting from OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC20Permit (for EIP-2612 support), Ownable2Step, and ReentrancyGuard. The contract manages dividend distribution using magnified dividend per share, fees via mulDiv for precision, and liquidity pair detection for DEX compatibility. Key state variables include:

**What this does:** manages dividend distribution using magnified dividend per share mechanism and tracks user dividend accumulations.

```solidity
uint256 public immutable TOTAL_SUPPLY = 1250000000 * 1e18;
uint256 public immutable BURNING_LIMIT = TOTAL_SUPPLY / 5;
uint256 private constant MAGNITUDE = 2**128; // For dividend precision
uint256 private magnifiedDividendPerShare; // Global dividend tracking
mapping(address => uint256) private lastDividendPerShare; // User dividend tracking
mapping(address => uint256) private accumulatedDividends; // User accumulated dividends
```

Below, we delve into core functions with code snippets.

### Balance and Supply Management

Balances use standard ERC20 implementation; total supply decreases as tokens are burned up to the burn limit.

**What this does:** provides standard ERC20 balance and supply functions, with total supply tracking burned tokens.

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) public view override returns (uint256) {
    return super.balanceOf(account);
}

function totalSupply() public view override returns (uint256) {
    return TOTAL_SUPPLY - totalBurned;
}
```

### Purchase Mechanism (Buy)

Users buy UTR by sending native currency to the contract. **Acquisition and Pricing:** Employs a bonding curve for transparent, front-run-proof pricing. Buys inject BNB directly, with UTR transferred from contract reserves. The 0.1% buy premium over refund price ensures refunded tokens are always sold at a higher price, creating a natural ratchet for value accrual. This simplifies entry—no collateral types or vesting.

**What this does:** calculates tokens purchasable from native input, applies three fees (dev, reserve, dividend), distributes dividends, then transfers tokens to the buyer.

```solidity
function _buy(address buyer, uint256 amountNative) private nonReentrant {
    if (amountNative < MINIMUM_PURCHASE_NATIVE) revert InsufficientNative();

    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance - amountNative;
    uint256 utrToPurchase = _getUtrForNative(amountNative, balanceBefore);

    if (utrToPurchase == 0) revert InsufficientNative();
    if (tokensSold + utrToPurchase > TOTAL_SUPPLY) revert InsufficientBalance();

    uint256 devFee = Math.mulDiv(utrToPurchase, BUY_DEV_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 5 BPS
    uint256 reserveFee = Math.mulDiv(utrToPurchase, BUY_RESERVE_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 10 BPS
    uint256 dividendFee = Math.mulDiv(utrToPurchase, BUY_REFLECTION_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 10 BPS
    uint256 utrToUser;
    unchecked {
        utrToUser = utrToPurchase - devFee - reserveFee - dividendFee;
    }

    tokensSold = tokensSold + utrToPurchase;

    super._transfer(address(this), devAddress, devFee);
    super._transfer(address(this), buyer, utrToUser);
    
    // Distribute dividend fee as dividends
    _distributeDividends(dividendFee);

    emit Buy(buyer, amountNative, utrToUser);
}
```

The `_getUtrForNative` function implements a transparent bonding curve that computes tokens based on backing value and current circulating supply. This is the core pricing mechanism that ensures fair, predictable pricing without external dependencies.

**What this does:** calculates how many UTR tokens can be purchased with a given amount of BNB using the bonding curve pricing mechanism.

```solidity
function _getUtrForNative(uint256 nativeAmount, uint256 balanceBefore) private view returns (uint256) {
    if (nativeAmount == 0) return 0;
    uint256 availableToSell = balanceOf(address(this));
    if (availableToSell == 0) return 0;

    uint256 circulating = totalSupply() - availableToSell;

    uint256 pricePerToken;
    if (circulating == 0 || balanceBefore == 0) {
        pricePerToken = BASE_PRICE; // 0.0001 BNB
    } else {
        uint256 refundPrice = (balanceBefore * 1e18) / circulating;
        pricePerToken = (refundPrice * 10010) / PRECISION_DIVISOR;
    }

    uint256 tokensToPurchase = (nativeAmount * 1e18) / pricePerToken;
    return Math.min(tokensToPurchase, availableToSell);
}
```

**Mathematical Breakdown:**
- **Initial State:** When no tokens are in circulation, price = 0.0001 BNB (BASE_PRICE)
- **Dynamic Pricing:** When tokens circulate, price = (contract BNB balance / circulating supply) × 1.001
- **0.1% Premium:** The ×10010/10000 factor adds a 0.1% premium over refund price to ensure contract sustainability
- **Supply Constraint:** Purchase is limited by available tokens in contract balance

**Example Calculation:** If contract has 100 BNB and 1,000,000 UTR tokens are circulating:
- Refund price = (100 × 1e18) / 1,000,000 = 0.0001 BNB per token
- Buy price = 0.0001 × 10010 / 10000 = 0.0001001 BNB per token
- For 1 BNB purchase: tokens = (1 × 1e18) / 0.0001001 = 9,990,010 UTR tokens

This mechanism ensures fair pricing that reflects the contract's actual reserves and prevents front-running attacks by using the contract's balance as the price discovery mechanism.

### Refund Mechanism

Users can refund UTR tokens for native currency, but the actual payout is calculated at 99.9% of backing value after fees are deducted from the UTR amount. **Exit and Liquidity:** Unique refund to contract provides OTC-like liquidity at fair value, bypassing DEX slippage. BNB outflow is buffered (999/1000 effective backing), preserving reserves. OTC-style refunds to contract provide slippage-free exits, backed by reserves. The key distinction is that fees are applied to the UTR amount before conversion, not to the BNB payout.

**What this does:** calculates refund value against effective backing, applies four fees (dev, dividend, burn, reserve), handles burn limit logic, distributes dividends, then sends native to the user.

```solidity
function _handleRefund(address sender, uint256 utrAmount) private nonReentrant {
    if (utrAmount == 0) revert ReflexusAmount();

    uint256 _totalBurned = totalBurned;

    uint256 devFeeUTR = Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, REFUND_DEV_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 5 BPS
    uint256 dividendFeeUTR = Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, REFUND_REFLECTION_FEE_BPS, 10000); // 5 BPS
    uint256 burnFeeUTR = (_totalBurned < BURNING_LIMIT) ? Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 75, 100000) : 0; // 7.5 BPS or 0
    uint256 reserveFeeUTR = (_totalBurned < BURNING_LIMIT) ? Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 75, 100000) : Math.mulDiv(utrAmount, 150, 100000); // 7.5 or 15 BPS
    
    uint256 utrForUserRefund;
    unchecked {
        utrForUserRefund = utrAmount - devFeeUTR - dividendFeeUTR - burnFeeUTR - reserveFeeUTR;
    }

    uint256 contractBalance = balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 currentCirculatingSupply = (TOTAL_SUPPLY - _totalBurned) - contractBalance + utrAmount;
    
    if (currentCirculatingSupply == 0) revert NoTokensInCirculation();

    uint256 effectiveBacking = (address(this).balance * EFFECTIVE_BACKING_NUMERATOR) / EFFECTIVE_BACKING_DENOMINATOR;
    uint256 grossNativeValue = (utrForUserRefund * effectiveBacking) / currentCirculatingSupply;

    if (devFeeUTR != 0) {
        super._transfer(address(this), devAddress, devFeeUTR);
    }
    if (burnFeeUTR != 0 && _totalBurned < BURNING_LIMIT) {
        uint256 remainingToBurn = BURNING_LIMIT - _totalBurned;
        if (burnFeeUTR > remainingToBurn) {
            burnFeeUTR = remainingToBurn;
        }
        if (burnFeeUTR != 0) {
            _burn(address(this), burnFeeUTR);
            totalBurned = totalBurned + burnFeeUTR;
        }
    }
    
    // Distribute dividend fee as dividends
    _distributeDividends(dividendFeeUTR);

    emit Refund(sender, utrAmount, grossNativeValue);

    (bool success, ) = sender.call{value: grossNativeValue}("");
    if (!success) revert NativeTransferFailed();
}
```

### Direct Contract Interaction

UTR can be used completely independently without any apps, DEX interfaces, or third-party services. Users can interact directly with the smart contract using their wallet or BSCScan, providing true decentralization and censorship resistance.

#### Direct Contract Functions Available:

**Buy UTR Tokens**

- Automatic refund calculation and BNB transfer
- No slippage, guaranteed liquidity

**Claim Dividends**
- Call `claimDividends()` function
- Check `pendingDividends(address)` first
- Direct to wallet, no intermediate steps

#### Benefits of Direct Contract Interaction:
- **True Decentralization:** No reliance on websites, apps, or third-party services
- **Censorship Resistance:** Cannot be blocked or shut down by external parties
- **Always Available:** Contract functions work 24/7, regardless of app maintenance
- **Transparent:** All interactions are publicly visible on BSCScan
- **Lower Risk:** No intermediary that could be compromised or fail

### DEX Integration & PancakeSwap V2 Compatibility

UTR is optimized for PancakeSwap V2 liquidity pools and swaps, ensuring seamless integration with BSC's primary DEX. The contract automatically detects and handles PancakeSwap V2 pair interactions, applying appropriate fee structures for buy/sell operations through the DEX interface. This optimization ensures users can trade UTR on PancakeSwap V2 with proper fee handling and dividend distribution.

### Dividend Distribution System

Dividends are distributed using a magnified dividend per share mechanism, allowing holders to manually claim their proportional rewards. **Eligibility:** Only EOAs (non-contract addresses) qualify. Contracts (e.g., DEX pairs, routers, farms, bridges) are auto-excluded to focus rewards on human holders and avoid DeFi exploits.

```solidity
function _distributeDividends(uint256 amount) private {
    if (amount == 0) return;
    
    uint256 circulatingSupply = getCirculatingSupply();
    if (circulatingSupply == 0) return;

    // Calculate dividend per share based on circulating supply only
    uint256 dividendPerShare = (amount * MAGNITUDE) / circulatingSupply;
    
    // Update global dividend tracking
    magnifiedDividendPerShare += dividendPerShare;
    totalDividendsDistributed += amount;
    
    emit DividendsDistributed(amount, magnifiedDividendPerShare);
}

function claimDividends() external {
    address user = msg.sender;
    
    // Exclude contracts from dividend claiming
    if (isContract(user)) return;
    
    uint256 userBalance = balanceOf(user);
    if (userBalance == 0) return;
    
    // Calculate and transfer accumulated dividends
    uint256 totalAccumulated = accumulatedDividends[user];
    if (totalAccumulated > 0) {
        accumulatedDividends[user] = 0;
        super._transfer(address(this), user, totalAccumulated);
        emit DividendWithdrawn(user, totalAccumulated);
    }
}
```
